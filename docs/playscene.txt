Playscene 
=========

Allows creating scripted cutscenes using the media Exult knows how to handle.
Namely FLIC animations, audio files OGG, WAV, VOC and also playback of a games'
music and sfx tracks.

To start a scripted scene use
		if (scene_available("name")) {
			play_scene("name");
		}

'scene_available("name")' looks for the files name_info.txt and name.flx in
a game's or a mod's patch folder, which play_scene("name") will play back.

Exult will automatically look for intro, endgame, quotes and credits
cutscenes in the above mentioned folders (files: intro_info.txt,
intro.flx, endgame_info.txt, ...) and play these instead of the orignal.

The script is loosely based on the format we use for de-hardcoded shape
informations.

There are three possible sections:
	- version (only used if we significantly alter the format and need
	  to discard older scripts)

	- scene: This is for playing FLIC animations, audio and subtitles.
	
	- text: This is for displaying text, either as scrolling (bottom -> top)
	  or as pages that are shwon with a dely. Audio can be played back as well.

You can have several scene and text sections which will be played in the 
written order.

In the future it might be possible to start cutscenes via usecode.


Example Script:
---------------

%%section version
:1
%%endsection

%%section scene
#		:flic/index_number/fade_in/fade_out
#
#		:sfx/sfx_number/frame_number/continue
#
#		:track/track_number/frame_number/continue
#
#		:ogg/index_number/frame_number/continue
#
#		:wave/index_number/frame_number/continue
#
#		:voc/index_number/frame_number/continue
#		When speech is disabled, VOCs will not play.
#
#		:subtitle/index_number/frame_number/line_number/font/color/duration
#		Subtitles are dependent on our global options. Color is not working atm.
#
#		index_number is the order of files in the corresponding flx file.
#
#		frame_number of the playing flic on which audio starts playing
#
#		continue lets audio play continue playing even though it's scene or
#		text section has finished playing.
#
#		line_number: subtitle texts are using numbered lines and then the same
#		format as text in the section text - see below
#		Example:
#		001:\CTis is a centered subtitle
#
#		duration is the number of frames a subtitle is shwon on screen
#		(default is 15 frames). 

:flic/0/0/0
:track/22/10/1
:sfx/36/0/0

%%endsection

%%section text
#		:text/index_number/font/color/scroll_or_delay(duration)
#
#		:sfx/sfx_number/textblock_number/continue
#
#		:track/track_number/textblock_number/continue
#		Tracks' volume can only be changed by the Volume Mixer.
#
#		:ogg/index_number/textblock_number/continue
#
#		:wave/index_number/textblock_number/continue
#
#		:voc/index_number/textblock_number/continue
#
#		index_number is the order of files in the corresponding flx file.
#
#		font switches between our Credits font and Hot font. The shape is the same
#		but the possible colors are different.
#
#		Credits font colors: 0=light orange,  1=bright orange , 2=green, 3=white,
#		4=bright pink, 5=white & grey screen, 6=bright green, 7=dark pink,
#		8=white & red screen, 9=white & dark purple screen, 10=pink, 11=pink & dark reddish screen,
#		12=menu blue, 13=green/yellow, 14=deep red, 15=yellow, 16=grey, 17=pink/brownred
#
#		Hot font colors:  0=light orange, 1=orange, 2=green, 3=white/grey,
#		4=bright orange, 5=orange & grey screen, 6=yellow, 7=dark orange, 
#		8=yellow & red screen, 9=yellow & dark purple screen, 10=dark orange, 11=dark orange & dark reddish screen,
#		12=lighter blue, 13=dark grey/yellow, 14=deep blue, 15=washed out pink, 16=bright green,  17=pink/brownred
#
#		textblock_number counts the blocks of texts (starting with 0) that are sperated by empty lines and 
#		on which audio will start playing. Other than delay text, scrolling text only allows instant start 
#		of audio (set to 0)
#
#		continue lets audio play continue playing even though it's scene or 
#		text section has finished playing.
#
#		scroll_or_delay(duration): 0 for scrolling text, 1 for text in blocks that have a delay of 3000ms
#		before the next block is shown. Any number higher than 1 is the new delay time in milliseconds.
#
#		Text format: 
#			- Lines that begin with \C are centered.
#			- Lines that begin with \L are left alligned to the right of the center.
#			- Lines that begin with \R are right alligned to the left of the center.
#			- Lines without these begin at the left with 10px margin.
#			- empty lines will trigger a new page in delayed text or show as empty in scrolling text.
#
#		Text example:
#		Unformatted text begins at the left with 10px margin.
#		\CCentered text.
#		\LLeft aligned to the right of the center.
#		\RRight aligned to the left of the center.
#

:text/1/0/12/1
:track/22/0/0
:sfx/36/0/0

Notes and limitations
---------------------

- Audio volume is tied to the global volume set in the Volume Mixer. Track is using the music volume, sfx, wave and ogg
  the sound effects volume and voc the speech volume.
- As ogg's can and should be played regardless of the digital music setting, ogg playback is treated as sfx playback.
- Scrolling text only allows starting audio at the beginning as our textscroll function has no means to tell us its state.
- Scrolling text speed cannot be set but sped up by holding down SHIFT.
- Subtitles' color cannot be set as these depend on the palette of the underlying flic animation.
- The listed colors are for a BG game, in case of SI the colors are different again. You might just have to test it out.
- ESC stops the cutscene completely, SPACE skips to the enxt section.


Scene FLX creation
------------------

To create the FLX file you need expack from our tools and for ease of use a build script.

For example an intro cutscene:
- In your patch folder or mods data folder create 'intro_info.txt' and the folder 'intro'.
- Place all the files you need for your cutscene into the 'intro' folder. 
  For example 'animation1.flc', 'animation2.flc', 'music.ogg', 'sfx1.wav', 'voice1.voc', 'text1.txt', 'subtitles.txt'
- create a text file called 'intro.in' in the 'intro' folder and add all the files and point at where the flx should
  be created (example below).
- run expack -i intro.in

intro.in example (this will create intro.flx in the same folder that holds intro_info.txt):

../intro.flx
animation1.flc
animation2.flc
music.ogg
sfx1.wav
voice1.voc
text1.txt
subtitles.txt
