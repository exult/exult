The GIMP shapes plug-in
=======================

This Plug-In is for the macOS Port of The Gimp. It is tested with the latest version of Gimp 3 (3.0) and runs on macOS 11.1 and newer, on either Intel 64bit or Apple Silicon. 
With it you can edit *.shp files used by Exult and the original Ultima VII. These shapes are compressed into *.flx or *.vga files. Use expack from our tools download to extract the files.
